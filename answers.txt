1. specifying TCP socket: socket.SOCK_STREAM
2. A server socket listens for incoming connections and a client socket is used to send and receive data
3. setsockopt
    "s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)"
    the 1 here is specifying whether or not to set the SO_REUSEADDR socket option. 
    When this option is set, the operating system allows you to use the same port 
    number to accept incoming connections even if a socket bound to this port is already in use.
4. The IP address and the port number from which the client is connecting
5. recv() returns an empty byte string indicating that the connection has been closed
